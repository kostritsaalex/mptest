## Description
Tired of spam bots in your WordPress and ClassicPress website? Do you want to get rid of false registrations and other spammy nonsense? Don't wan't to use a clumsy and user-unfriendly Captcha? Don't want to use a Captcha from Google or other big-tech company period?

Meet **No-Bot Registration**, easy to use, superior protection without making it hard for your visitors. Easily blacklist (partial) email addresses and domains so they can no longer register an account. \
Create one or more questions and a set of possible answers for them and visitors have to answer your question when they register.
If they answer wrong, they get denied their account.

Questions can be as simple as "1 + 1", with possible answers being 1, one or uno. That way you can plan for eventualities and how people interpret your question.
